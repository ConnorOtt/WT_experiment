# WT_experiment
Files and data for developing the WT_experiment MATLAB class

This is my first try at Object Oriented Programming in MATLAB. The idea is that every single wind tunnel experiment performed in CU
Boulder's ITLL wind tunnel outputs data in the same format, so an object which can manage that data would be nice to have.

### Implimentation
So far, the data accompanying this code corresponds to sting balance experiments and static port measurement experiments, and has 
only been rigorously tested with sting balance data. More testing and massaging is almost certainly necessary, and the object will 
be updated as new experiments come along.
